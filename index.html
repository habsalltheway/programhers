    <center><div> The consumption crisis is a very serious issue that can be interpreted in many many ways. one of the first thoughts
      many people have when they hear about consumption is food. It is often interpreted as a waste of food and edidle material. When 
      this first comes to mind they are not incorrect at all. Food waste is one of the largest present consumption issues. Along with
       this a huge part of consumption is in product waste, such as electronics, clothing, etc. Unfortunatley in our modern world, when an 
       issue appears with a certain product it seems that for many the first idea is when and where they can buy a new one. The product
        is then disposed of and therefore put to waste. According to BBC news" While the world produces 2.1bn tonnes of this rubbish every 
        year, only 16% is recycled while 46% is disposed of unsustainably.In the analysis, China and India make up over 36% of the global
         population and account for 27% of the waste. US citizens produce 773kg per head of population, roughly 12% of the global total. 
         Their output is three times that of their Chinese counterparts and seven times more than people living in Ethiopia.</div></center>
